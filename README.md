Welcome to Boston Massachusetts in the 1970s! Imagine you're working for a real estate development company. Your company wants to value any residential project before they start. You are tasked with building a model that can provide a price estimate based on a home's characteristics like:

- The number of rooms
- The distance to employment centres
- How rich or poor the area is
- How many students there are per teacher in local schools etc
